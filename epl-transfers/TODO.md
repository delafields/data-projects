# TODOs

1. Make the call on whether to use RMD or a juypter notebook

## Overarching question and the primary thing being explored
* What teams got an unexpected injection of $? When did this happen? What was the result?

## Additional data points // some anecdotal things
* Who conducts the most loans?
    * This could be as simple as a well designed countplot.

## Pure visualization
* Net transfer $ ranking vs. end of season ranking
    * Data is in the right place. Just need to GET THE ANIMATION DOWN
    * Maybe do an "overall" one and average ranking? (Gonna have to rank 0 for relegated teams)
* How have transfer amounts changed per position year over year?
    * This is going to be a line plot - the only thing left to explore is whether to group by D/MF/Fwds
    * DONE except for styling
