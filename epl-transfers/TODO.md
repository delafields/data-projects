# TODOs

1. Make the call on whether to use RMD or a juypter notebook
2. Do I want to adjust for inflation? Thinking yes. Consider how to do this properly.
3. Create functions to..
    * Aggregate net sales by team
    * Grab number of transfers

## Overarching question and the primary thing being explored
* What teams got an unexpected injection of $? When did this happen? What was the result?

## Additional data points // some anecdotal things
* How many transfers per win/point gained
* How much was spent per win/point gained
* Who conducts the most loans?
* Who gets the most bang for their buck (spends the least and gets results)

## Pure visualization
* Net transfer $ ranking vs. end of season ranking
* How have transfer amounts changed per position year over year?
