# TODOs

## Overarching question and the primary thing being explored
* What teams got an unexpected injection of $? When did this happen? What was the result?
    * Make the call on whether to use RMD or a juypter notebook

## Additional data points // some anecdotal things
Do a quick write up + add to viz repo:
* Spend per year
* Who conducts the most loans?
* Net transfer $ ranking vs. end of season ranking
* How have transfer amounts changed per position year over year?
