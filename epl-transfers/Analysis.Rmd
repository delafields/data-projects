# Who is getting their money's worth in the English Premier League?

In [my last post](https://www.jfields.me/blog/the-epl-s-modern-transfer-market-in-data), I presented a few plots around some data I put together around the EPL's transfer market. In this post, I tie the transfer market into the actual season results to see the effect of transfers. Unlike my last post, this one will be a little more involved, with code to boot.

All data can be found in my [epl-transfers repo](https://github.com/delafields/data-projects/tree/master/epl-transfers).

## Transfer Trends
I first did some exploration around what the overall trend in terms of £'s spent looked like, just to get a feel for the data and formulate some ideas for analysis.

![](C:/Users/jfields/Desktop/Code/data-projects/epl-transfers/plots/total_spend_YoY.png)

In order to analyze the current market, it would be wise to set a cutoff date for it. From the chart above we can clearly see an upward trend starting in 2011 right after a steady crash in 2008 (not much of a surprise). 

Setting a cutoff year gives us the added benefit of not having to do a lot of work around promotion/relegation. 3 teams get sent up to the EPL from the Championship and vise versa every year, which could skew some of the features we put together later.

## Data Processing

**Skip to the next section if you aren't interested**

First, we'll join results (Wins, Points, Position, etc.) to transfer data (Fee, transfer movement, etc.).
```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

####### Import data #######

# handy function to merge csvs together
# (via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30242065/trying-to-merge-multiple-csv-files-in-r/30242347)
multmerge = function(path){
    filenames = list.files(path=path, full.names=TRUE)
    
    datalist = lapply(filenames, function(x){
        read.csv(file = x, header = T)})
    
    Reduce(function(x, y) {merge(x, y, all = TRUE)}, datalist)
}

transfer_data <- multmerge("data/transfer-data")
results_data  <- multmerge("data/epl-results")
inflation <- read.csv(file = "data/Inflation_Adjustment.csv", fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM")

####### Data Processing #######

transfer_data <- rename(transfer_data, Team = club_name)  # rename `club_name` to `Team` to match results
transfer_data[is.na(transfer_data)] <- 0                  # replace na's

grouped_transfer_data <- transfer_data %>%
  left_join(inflation, by = "year") %>%
  mutate(corrected_fee = ifelse(transfer_movement == "out", 
                                fee_cleaned * -1, 
                                fee_cleaned),                        # negate "out" transfers
         adj_fee = corrected_fee * (1 + .01 * inflation$Inflation),  # adjust for inflation
         Team = str_replace_all(Team, " FC", ""),                    # match results table names
         Team = str_replace_all(Team, "AFC", ""),                    # match results table names
         Team = trimws(Team)) %>%
  group_by(Team, year) %>%
  summarise(total_spend = sum(adj_fee))


results_data <- results_data %>% 
  rename(QualRel = Qualification.or.relegation) %>%
  mutate(Team = str_replace_all(Team, " \\(\\S\\)", ""),  # remove the (C)'s and (R)'s from Team names
         year = as.numeric(substr(year, start = 1, stop = 4)),        # trim year to just the first yyyy
         # bucket into qualification/relegation
         QualRel = case_when(str_detect(QualRel, "Champions League") == TRUE ~ "Champions League",        
                             str_detect(QualRel, "Europa League")    == TRUE ~ "Europa League",
                             str_detect(QualRel, "Relegation")       == TRUE ~ "Relegated",
                             TRUE ~ "Midtable"))

    
# join transfers to results
epl_data <- results_data %>% 
    right_join(grouped_transfer_data, by = c("Team", "year")) %>%
    arrange(year) %>%
    filter(year >= 2011) # our cutoff

head(epl_data)
```

### Feature Engineering

To be able to see how teams results changed as an effect of their spend, we'll create a few new features: `WinChange`, `LossChange`, `GFChange`, `GAChange`, and `PtsChange.` Ex: you have 20 wins in 2013 and 18 wins in 2014, the 2014 `WinChange` will equal -2.

Ultimately we're concered about the effects of spending, so we'll create a few more features. We'll divide all of our `{}Change` features by `total_spend` (the amount spend that season) to get to create a feature like `MillPerPtsGained` (how many millions of £ spent per point gained).

```{r message=FALSE}

# convert year back to date to calculate lag and convert Pts to numeric
epl_data <- epl_data %>% mutate(year = as.Date(ISOdate(year, 1, 1)), Pts = as.numeric(Pts))

# calc YoY points change
epl_data <- epl_data %>% group_by(Team) %>%
    arrange(year) %>%
    mutate(WinChange  = W   - lag(W, 1),
           LossChange = L   - lag(L, 1),
           PtsChange  = Pts - lag(Pts, 1),
           GFChange   = GF  - lag(GF, 1),
           GAChange   = GA  - lag(GA, 1)) %>%
    mutate(MillPerWinGained  = total_spend / WinChange,
           MillPerLossGained = total_spend / LossChange,
           MillPerPtsGained  = total_spend / PtsChange,
           MillPerGFGained   = total_spend / GFChange,
           MillPerGAGained   = total_spend / GAChange) %>%
    na.omit() # removes 2011 data and pro/rel teams

# replace inf's
epl_data[epl_data == -Inf | epl_data == Inf] <- 0

# remove later
arsenal <- epl_data %>% filter(Team == 'Arsenal')

head(epl_data %>% select(year, total_spend, PtsChange, MillPerPtsGained))
```

## So, who got their money's worth?

Let's first take a look at what teams have performed above average in this time frame. To do this, we'll calculate the historical point average for the EPL.

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 12, fig.align = "center"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

per_team <- epl_data %>%
    group_by(Team) %>%
    summarise(avg_spend               = mean(total_spend),
              total_spend             = sum(total_spend),
              avg_pts                 = mean(Pts),
              avg_pts_change          = mean(PtsChange),
              avg_mill_per_pts_gained = mean(MillPerPtsGained))

historical_pts_average <- results_data %>% 
    mutate(Pts = as.numeric(str_replace_all(Pts, "19[c]", ""))) %>%  # one weird data point
    summarise(mean_pts = mean(Pts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pull()  

ggplot(per_team, aes(x = avg_spend, y = avg_pts)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#38003c", fill = "#00ff85", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = as.double(historical_pts_average), color="#e90052", linetype="dashed") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = paste(Team, "(£", round(avg_spend, 2), "M)")),
                  data = subset(per_team, avg_pts > as.double(historical_pts_average)),
                  point.padding = 0.5, segment.color = "grey50", family = "poppins") +
  labs(y = "Average Points Per Season", x = "Average Spend Per Season") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        axis.line.x = element_line(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank())

```

The Big 6 are represented well here! That's Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, and Tottenham. The horizontal line is the historical points average, so everyone above that is performing above average. Some standout points here:

* City is spending the most and in turn, seeing having the most success
* United spends a ton but haven't separated themselves, points-wise, from the rest of the Big 6
* Tottenham has done the most with the least amount of spend - they actually average a profit in the transfer market (< 0)


Premier League teams have goals outside of winning the league itself. They also look to qualify for the Champions League (by ranking 1-4), qualify for Europa League (by ranking 5-6), and avoid relegation (ranking 18-20). Let's look at the effect of spend on these qualifications:

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 15, fig.align = "center"}

average_QualRel <- epl_data %>% group_by(QualRel) %>% summarise(total_spend = mean(total_spend))

ggplot(epl_data, aes(x = total_spend, y = QualRel, size = 3)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#38003c", fill = "#00ff85", size = 4, stroke = 2) + 
  geom_point(data = average_QualRel, color = "red", shape = "diamond", alpha = 0.75) +
  labs(x = "Season Spend", y = "", size="Average Spend") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = paste(Team, "(£", round(total_spend, 2), "M)", sep = "")),
                  data = subset(epl_data, 
                                (QualRel == "Champions League" & total_spend < -10) | 
                                (QualRel == 'Champions League' & total_spend > 200) | 
                                (QualRel == "Relegated" & total_spend > 100)),
                  point.padding = 0.5, segment.color = "grey50", family = "poppins", show.legend = FALSE, nudge_y = 0.5, size = 4) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 8),
        axis.line.x = element_line(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.75, 0.75))

```

Of the points I've labeled, the top right are bad business, the points in the bottom left are good business.

For the uninformed - teams get a nice purse from making the Champions League followed by a little less from the Europa League. Teams that qualified for the Champions League *clearly* spend more, as it's a worthy investment.

It's fascinating to see that relegated teams, on average, spend more than midtable and Europa League squads (I'm labeling non-qualifiers and non-relegators as midtable).

Outside of these raw, overall trends, I'm really interested to see what specific transfer windows had the biggest effect on the next season. We can look at the `MillPerPtsGained` feature we created to see how many £'s were spent for a gain in points.

Change in points is the most important feature here in my opinion. It is predicated upon Wins, Losses, and Draws - Goals For and Goals Against play into it as well. And...it determines the league winner, european league competitions, and relegation...

Let's look at seasons where teams have seen a +20 point swing and how much they spent to get there.

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center"}


ggplot(epl_data, aes(y = total_spend, x = PtsChange)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#38003c", fill = "#00ff85", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse(PtsChange > 20, 
                                     paste(Team, " ", PtsChange, " pts\n for £", round(total_spend), "M", sep = ""),
                                     '')), 
                  family = "poppins", direction = "y", segment.color = "grey50", point.padding = 0.5) +
  labs(y = "Season Spend", x = "Points Change From Last Season") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 8),
        axis.line.x = element_line(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank())

```

Because we're talking about cash, let's look at some players who were brought in by the labeled teams that spent > £100M:

* City: Aymeric Laporte, Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Ederson, Kyle Walker
* Liverpool: Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho
* Wolverhampton: Adama Traore, Rui Patricio, Diogo Jota, Raul Jimenez, Joao Moutinho

These all contain players who, at the time of writing, are important players for each team. They spent on some studs.

Now, the points where teams have seen a +20 point swing in a season and how much they spent to get there.


```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(epl_data, aes(y = total_spend, x = PtsChange)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#38003c", fill = "#00ff85", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse((PtsChange < -20 & total_spend > 0), 
                                     paste(Team, " ", PtsChange, " pts\n for £", round(total_spend), "M", sep = ""),
                                     '')), 
                  family = "poppins", direction = "y", segment.color = "grey50", nudge_x = -20, size = 4, force = 10) +
  labs(y = "Season Spend", x = "Points Change From Last Season") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  xlim(-75, NA) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 8),
        axis.line.x = element_line(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank())
```

*The negative x-axis was expanded to fit the labels.*

The highlighted points are tragic by all means but the Liverpool and Manchester United points are especially bad because of how much they spent. Who'd they spend on here?

* Liverpool (2014): Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Mario Balotelli
* United (2013): 	Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata

Ehm, wouldn't call those Liverpool buys as successful.

Let's look at who has spent the most/least for small point swings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if it's in the red as long as you stay in the league. Also, you can only top out at so many points - you might just be spending to maintain your position in the table.

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center"}


ggplot(epl_data, aes(y = MillPerPtsGained, x = PtsChange)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#38003c", fill = "#00ff85", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse(abs(MillPerPtsGained) > 50, 
                                     paste(Team, " (", substr(year, start = 1, stop = 4), ")", sep = ""),
                                     '')), 
                  family = "poppins", direction = "y", xlim = c(15, NA), segment.color = "grey50") +
  labs(y = "Millions Per Point Change", x = "Points Change From Last Season") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 8),
        axis.line.x = element_line(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank())

```

Lol @ United.

Let's look at each team's smallest `MillPerPtsGained` - this should show the seasons where teams have spent the most and managed to lose points.

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}

worst_season <- epl_data %>%
  group_by(Team) %>%
  filter(MillPerPtsGained == min(MillPerPtsGained) & total_spend > 0)


ggplot(worst_season, aes(x = reorder(Team, MillPerPtsGained), y = MillPerPtsGained)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", size = 1, color="#38003c", fill = ifelse(worst_season$MillPerPtsGained > 0, "#00ff85", "red")) +
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(abs(worst_season$MillPerPtsGained) > 5, # to fit in the bars
                               round(worst_season$MillPerPtsGained, 2),
                               "")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), family = "poppins") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(worst_season$MillPerPtsGained < 0,
                               as.numeric(substr(worst_season$year, start = 1, stop = 4)),
                               "")),
            position=position_dodge(width=0.9), hjust = 1.25, family = "poppins") +
  labs(y = "Millions £ Spent Per Point Change") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix="£", suffix = "M")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "poppins"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#38003c", size = 8),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 5),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#e0e0e0", linetype = "dashed", size=0.1),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

```

If you're a supporter, I encourage you to twist the knife and explore your poorest spending season.

That's all. Thanks for reading. COYG!
