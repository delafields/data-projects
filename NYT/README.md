# NYT Bestsellers

# WELP - NYT HAS AN API FOR THIS.
It was a fun exercise in scraping/storing on s3. Ending this pursuit.

## TODO
* ~~fully functionize the scrape~~
* ~~push gzipped json to aws~~
    * delete file locally after upload
* create a 'current csv' and programatically push it to github
    * email it to me for quality control?
* create same process for specific pages
* get this bad boy into heroku
    * ~~running weekly (on thursdays)~~


## TO THINK ABOUT
When this thing is final - I want a running list of ~everything~ that has been on that list. Not just the latest version.
